# The Monkey Cave

Tools to simulate application behavior and misbehavior. Inspired by Netflix's Chaos Monkeys.

## The good monkeys

Simulate normal application behavior: 

* like a simple web service causing some I/O on incoming TCP requests.
* like a VM start up.

## The bad monkeys

Randomly spin up and cause I/O or other 'weird' behaviour patterns on the system.

## The intruding monkeys

Simulate DoS attacks.

More monkeys to come soon...

The monkeys are used by us to test a system which learns form application behavour and adjusts the overall system according to the learned knowledge. These monkeys here are used to test drive the system.
